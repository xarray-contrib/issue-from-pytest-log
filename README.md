# issue-from-pytest-log

Create an issue for failed tests from a [pytest-reportlog](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-reportlog) file or update an existing one if it already exists.

How this works:

1. `pytest-reportlog` writes a complete and machine-readable log of failed tests.
2. The action extracts the failed tests and creates a report while making sure that it fits into the character limits of github issue forms.
3. The action looks for existing open issues with the configured title and label
   a. if one exists: replace the old description with the report
   b. if there is none: open a new issue and insert the report

## Usage

To use the `issue-from-pytest-log` action in workflows, simply add a new step:

```yaml
jobs:
  my-job:
    ...
    strategy:
      fail-fast: false
      ...

    ...

    - uses: actions/setup-python@v4
      with:
        python-version: "3.11"
        cache: pip

    ...

    - run: <
        pip install --upgrade pytest-reportlog

    ...

    - run: <
        pytest --report-log pytest-log.jsonl

    ...

    - uses: xarray-contrib/issue-from-pytest-log@main
      if: |
        failure()
        && ...
      with:
        log-path: pytest-log.jsonl
```

## Options

### log path

required.

Use `log-path` to specify where the output of `pytest-reportlog` is.

### issue title

optional. Default: `⚠️ Nightly upstream-dev CI failed ⚠️`

In case you don't like the default title for new issues, this setting can be used to set a different one:

```yaml
- uses: xarray-contrib/issue-from-pytest-log@v1
  with:
    log-path: pytest-log.jsonl
    issue-title: "Nightly CI failed"
```

The title can also be parametrized, in which case a separate issue will be opened for each variation of the title.

### issue label

optional. Default: `CI`

The label to set on the new issue.

```yaml
- uses: xarray-contrib/issue-from-pytest-log@v1
  with:
    log-path: pytest-log.jsonl
    issue-label: "CI"
```
